        Unless you have a lot of passion about this, you're not gonna survive. You're going to give up.
        So you've got to have an idea, or a problem or a wrong that you want to right that you're passionate about;

             The ones who see differently. They're not fond of rules. 
            And they have no respect of the status-quo.
            You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.
            About the only thing that you can't do is ignore them.
            Because they change things. They push the human race forward.
            While some see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
            Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do."
